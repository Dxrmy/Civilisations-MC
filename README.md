**Civilisations** is a profound overhaul of the Minecraft world-gen and entity systems. It breathes life into the world by introducing complex, ancient societies that build, defend, and evolve independently of the player.

## Features
- **Procedural Ruins & Cities:** Architecture-focused world-gen that places significant structures with historical context.
- **Social AI Layer:** Custom entity logic for Soldiers and Citizens that react to players, threats, and resource availability.
- **Historical Lore System:** Discoverable artifacts and clues that tell the story of the societies that came before.
- **Native Fabric Performance:** Leverages the latest Fabric toolchain for zero-impact on server TPS.

## 🚧 Roadmap & Todo
State of the project as of latest push:

- [x] **Civ-Gen Engine**: Basic ruin placement and dungeon generation logic.
- [x] **Entity Hub**: Base AI for Citizen and Soldier roles.
- [x] **Geckolib Integration**: Custom animations for new civilization entities.
- [/] **Economy**:
    - [/] Trade routes between procedural settlements (WIP pathfinding).
    - [ ] Resource-driven settlement expansion.
- [ ] **Quest System**: Goal-oriented interactions with city leaders.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Mod Loader**: Fabric API (1.21.11)
- **Animation**: GeckoLib 4
- **World-Gen**: Custom Structure-Piece Registry
